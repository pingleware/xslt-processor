XSLT-processor TODO
===================

* Deal with namespaces (if namespaces are not the same in XSLT and XML document, matches do no occur.)
* XSL:number
* XSL:for-each-group
* XSL:import
* XSL:include
* XSL:key
* XSL:fallback
* XSL:apply-imports
* XSL:attribute-set
* XSL:decimal-format
* XSL:message
* XSL:namespace-alias
* XSL:otherwise
* XSL:preserve-space
* XSL:processing-instruction
* XSL:strip-space

Help is much appreciated. It seems to currently work for most of our purposes, but fixes and additions are always welcome!

Additional tasks added to the list after search xslt.js source on the keyword 'not implemented'
